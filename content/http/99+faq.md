# FAQ

Everything you always wanted to know about *HTTP* (but were afraid to ask).

## How to save a binary file?

~~~~~ java
	final String link =
		"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2" +
		"/org/jodd/jodd-http/3.9.1/jodd-http-3.9.1.jar";

	HttpResponse response = HttpRequest
		.get(link)
		.send();

	byte[] bytes = response.bodyBytes();

	FileUtil.writeBytes(
		new File(SystemUtil.userHome(), "jodd-http.jar"), bytes);

## How to follow multi redirects?

`HttpRequest` by default does not follow the redirect instruction sent in response.
You can use `HttpBrowser`:

~~~~~ java
	HttpBrowser browser = new HttpBrowser();

	browser.sendRequest(HttpRequest.get("google.com"));

	// read response
	Response response = browser.getResponse();
	String page = browser.getPage();
~~~~~

Since **v4** the `HttpRequest` has the flag `followRedirects()` to
enable following the redirects:

~~~~~ java
	HttpResponse response =
		HttpRequest
			.get("google.com")
			.followRedirects(true)
			.send();
~~~~~


## What is the difference between HttpRequest and HttpBrowser?

`HttpRequest` represents just a single request; clean and simple.

`HttpBrowser` emulates browsing of a website (i.e. set of URLs) like a browser.
Besides sending requests, it also stores and resends cookies, maintaining
the current user session. Moreover, the `HttpBrowser` uses new request on
redirection following, allows common request headers for all the requests etc.


## Server chose TLSv1.2, but that protocol version is not enabled?

Just add the following property `-Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2` which configures the JVM to specify which TLS protocol version should be used during HTTPS connections.
