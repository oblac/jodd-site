# Json Parser

*Jodd* *Json* parser reads JSON string and converts it into objects (i.e. object graph). Mapping JSON data to Java objects may be tricky. *Jodd* *Json* uses class and property types to map string JSON values into specific Java type. And as a bonus, it is super fast.

## Basic usage

The parser class is `JsonParser`. When no target type is provided, parser will convert JSON string to Java `Map` and `List`. Like this:

~~~~~ java
	JsonParser jsonParser = new JsonParser();
	Map map = jsonParser.parse(
		"{ \"one\" : { \"two\" : 285 }, \"three\" : true}");
~~~~~

or as a one-liner:

~~~~~ java
	Map map = JsonParser.create().parse("{ ... }");
~~~~~

JSON string here is converted into a `Map` that contains 2 keys. One of the keys (`one`) holds another `Map` instance. As you can see from the example, simple JSON data types are converted into their counter-part Java types. Boolean value is converted to `Boolean`, number is converted to a `Number` or `BigInteger` etc. `JsonParser` finds the best possible type; for example, if number can be stored into an `int` then `Integer` is returned, but if it is a decimal value then `Double` is returned and so on.

Ok, let's now see how to map JSON to types.

## Parsing to types

Let's start with the JSON data:

~~~~~ json
	{
		"name" : "Mak",
		"bars" : {
			"123": {"amount" : 12300},
			"456": {"amount" : 45600}
		},
		"inters" : {
			"letterJ" : {"sign" : "J"},
			"letterO" : {"sign" : "O"},
			"letterD" : {"sign" : "D"}
		}
	}
~~~~~

This data can be mapped to Java type like:

~~~~~ java
	public class User {
		private String name;
		private Map<String, Bar> bars;
		private Map<String, Inter> inters;
		// ...
	}
~~~~~

Property `name` is a simple property. But `bars` is a `Map` of `Bars`:

~~~~~ java
	public class Bar {
		private Integer amount;
		// ...
	}
~~~~~

This is no problem for `JsonParser`. It will parse inner JSON maps to `Bar`
types, since the _generic_ type of the property specifies the map's
content type. In the same way `JsonParser` can handle the `inters` map.

~~~~~ java
	JsonParser jsonParser = new JsonParser();
	User user = jsonParser.parse(json, User.class);
~~~~~

`JsonParser` now converts JSON directly to a target type. Let's remember:

`JsonParser` lookups for type information from the target's property: the property type and generics informations.
{: .attn}

Using this approach, `JsonParser` can parse complex JSON strings into Java object graph, as long it can resolve the type information.


### Specifying target type

To introduce some more complexity, let's say that `Inter` is an interface:

~~~~~ java
	public interface Inter {
		public char getSign();
	}
~~~~~

and one of it's implementation is:

~~~~~ java
	public class InterImpl implements Inter {
		protected char sign;

		public char getSign() {
			return sign;
		}
		public void setSign(char sign) {
			this.sign = sign;
		}
	}
~~~~~

Now, this is something `JsonParser` can't figure out by looking at the `inters` property types and it's generic information. We need to explicitly specify the target type for maps values. As you could guess, we can use _path_ to specify the mapping. But in this case, the path needs to address the values of the map! No problem - by using special path name `value` we can address all the values of a map:

~~~~~ java
	User user = new JsonParser()
			.map("inters.values", InterImpl.class)
			.parse(json, User.class);
~~~~~

Nice! Similar with the `value`, we could specify the key's type, using the path reference `keys`. Look at the following example:

~~~~~ java
	String json = "{\"eee\" : {\"123\" : \"name\"}}";

	Map<String, Map<Long, String>> map =
			new JsonParser()
			.map("values.keys", Long.class)
			.parse(json);
~~~~~

We changed the key type of the inner map. This is one more thing to remember:

Use `map()` method to map target type in the result object graph, specified by it's path.
{: .attn}

Now we have a powerful tool that can parse about any JSON to any Java type. Here is another example:

~~~~~ json
	{
	  "1": {
	    "first": {
	      "areaCode": "404"
	    },
	    "second": {
	      "name": "Jodd"
	    }
	  }
	}
~~~~~

May be parsed like this:

~~~~~ java
	Map<String, Pair<Phone, Network>> complex = new JsonParser()
			.map("values", Pair.class)
			.map("values.first", Phone.class)
			.map("values.second", Network.class)
			.parse(json);
~~~~~

Each value of returned map is going to be a `Pair` of two different types.

### Alt(ernative) paths

As seen, path can contain special names like `values` or `keys` to reference _all_ values of a map or _all_ keys of a map (or of an array). But you can not change the type of particular map value, since these special paths address _all_ items.

But there is a solution for this. By enabling the alternative paths with `.useAltPaths()` we are telling `JsonParser` to match paths to current map values! By default this option is disabled, for performance reasons (there is some penalty because more paths are matched).

With alt paths enabled, you can reference any value in the map, too.


### Class meta-data name

Sometimes JSON string does contain an information about the target type, stored in 'special' key like `class` or `__class`. If you have such JSON or if you have used this option with `JsonSerializer`, you can enable this feature with `JsonParser` as well:

~~~~~ java
	Target target =
			new JsonParser()
			.setClassMetadataName("class")
			.parse(json);
~~~~~

Now every JSON map will be scanned for this special key `class` that holds the full class name of the target. But be careful:

Using class metadata name with `JsonParser` has some performance penalty and may introduce potential security risk.
{: .attn}

Every JSON map first must be converted to a `Map` so we can fetch the class name and then converted to a target class. Because of this double conversion expect performance penalties if using class metadata name.

There are **security risks** using class meta-data. You may expose a security hole in case untrusted source manages to specify a class that is accessible through class loader and exposes set of methods and/or fields, access of which opens an actual security hole. Such classes are known as _deserialization gadgets_.

Because of this, use of "default typing" is not encouraged in general, and in particular is recommended against if the source of content is not trusted. Conversely, default typing may be used for processing content in cases where both ends (sender and receiver) are controlled by same entity.

For additional security control there is method to whitelist allowed class names wildcards: `allowClass()`. If class name does not match one of set wildcard patterns, `JsonParser` will throw an exception. To reset the whitelist, use `allowAllClasses()`.

## Type conversion

As for everything in *Jodd*, `JoddParser` uses powerful `TypeConverter` to convert between strings to real types.

## Value converters

Sometimes data comes in different flavors. For example, `Date` may be specified as a string in `yyyy/MM/dd` format and not as a number of milliseconds. So we need to explicitly convert the string into `Date`. For that we can use `ValueConverter`:

~~~~~ java
	final SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy/MM/dd");

	Person person = new JsonParser()
			.withValueConverter("birthdate", new ValueConverter<String, Date>() {
				public Date convert(String data) {
					try {
						return dateFormat.parse(data);
					} catch (ParseException pe) {
						throw new JsonException(pe);
					}
				}
			})
			.parse(json, Person.class);
~~~~~

## Loose mode

*Json* parser consumes only valid JSON strings. If JSON string is not valid, an exception is thrown with detailed message of why parsing failed.

But real-world often does not play by the rules ;) Therefore, `JsonParser` may run in so-called _loose_ mode, when it can process more:

~~~~~ java
	JsonParser jsonParser = new JsonParser().looseMode(true);
~~~~~

Here is what loose mode may handle:

+ both single and double quotes are accepted.
+ invalid escape characters are just added to the ouput.
+ strings may be unquoted, too.

For example, `JsonParser` in loose mode may parse the following input:

~~~~~
    {
		key : value,
		'my' : 'hol\\x'
    }
~~~~~

This JSON is not valid, but it can be parsed, too.

## Lazy mode

Finally, the performance gem. Common scenario is parsing a (big) JSON document only to access few keys. For this situations we actually don't need to parse the complete JSON, only the elements that we need.

*Jodd* *Json* has the _lazy_ mode that provides exactly that feature. It returns the `Map` or the `List` i.e. in the lazy mode there is no sense to parse to concrete types. Returned object is lazy, since the parsing happens only on key retrieval.

This may boost performance a lot (in explained scenario)! The downside of this approach is that JSON string is kept in memory while the returned object exist. Please use lazy mode with care.

~~~~~ java
	JsonParser jsonParser = new JsonParser().lazy(true);
~~~~~

or as one-liner:

~~~~~ java
	JsonParser jsonParser = JsonParser.createLazyOne();
~~~~~
